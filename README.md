## Features
- **Interactive Sorting**: Users can watch popular algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more, sorting an array in real-time.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Highlights individual comparisons and swaps to make it easier for users to follow the logic of each algorithm.
- **Custom Inputs & Settings**: Users can input their own arrays or generate random ones, adjust the speed of visualization, and control the size of the array.
- **Learning Aid**: By coupling code visualization with sorting steps, the tool helps beginners grasp the core concepts behind algorithmic sorting in an engaging manner.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Functionality

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
### Algorithm Variety: Users can visualize several sorting algorithms, including:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Heap Sort
 Real-Time Visualization: Animates the sorting process in real time, showing comparisons,
 swaps, and progress as the array gets sorted.

## 2. Customization & Controls
 Algorithm Selection: Choose from a dropdown list of algorithms to visualize.
 Array Size Control: Adjust the size of the array to see how sorting is affected by different dataset sizes.
 Speed Control: Modify the speed of the sorting animation for a slower or faster demonstration.
 Array Generation: Generate random arrays of varying sizes for a randomized demonstration.

## 3. Sorting Process Interaction
 Pause/Resume: Pause the sorting visualization at any step and resume it when desired.
 Step-by-Step View: Observe each comparison and swap in the sorting process as it happens.
 Custom Array Input: Input your own array values to see how the algorithms handle custom datasets.

## 4. Code and Explanation Display
 Code Representation: Displays the code for the selected algorithm alongside the visualizer 
 to help users understand the algorithm's logic.
 Detailed Explanation: Provides textual explanations of each step in the sorting process to enhance comprehension.

## 5. Color-Coded Visuals
 Active Comparisons: Highlights elements being compared in a distinct color (e.g., yellow).
 Swapping Elements: Shows swapped elements in a different color (e.g., red).
 Sorted Elements: Highlights sorted elements in a final color (e.g., green) for clarity.

## 6. User-Friendly Interface
 Responsive Design: The application is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
 Reset and Replay: Reset the visualizer and start a new sorting demonstration with different settings.

## 7. Data Privacy
 Local Processing: All sorting operations and data are handled locally within the browser,
 ensuring user privacy.
